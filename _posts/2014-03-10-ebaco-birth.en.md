*Â¡The world of wine is lucky!*

The last month of March started de development of E-Baco ontology, an ontolgoy about oenology. 
In this project are working researchers of the Biology Faculty of the Complutense University of Madrid and of the Department of Applied Maths and Statistic of the San Pablo CEU University of Madrid. 
The goal of this project is to develop an ontology with a precise vocabulary for describing and modeling the world of wine in the [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). 
This ontology will be versatile enough to be used in different contex as wineries, restaurants, bars, wine shops, magazines, research, etc.)
In the news section of this page we will publish the advances in the development of this ontology.
